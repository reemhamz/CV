      <p>
        25 y/o data analyst switching to web development.
        I've worked in data analysis for nearly two years now, straight after graduating university. However, found myself to have gotten pretty burnt out by data scicence and where it was leading. Especially because it's <em>such</em> a broad and undefined field, and having not had a proper mentor to guide me through the <strong>valley of ill-identified streams</strong>, I felt as if I was very alone and thought it was best for my mental health to go into something a bit more defined with a larger, more open community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've decided to move to Lebanon before returning back to Canada to study web development online. It looked like the most financially feasible option as I would be staying with my parents, basically rent-free.
        To pass the time and have some sort of interesting social life, I started working part-time as a barista at the only proper speciality coffee shop in the country and I'm absolutely loving it. You can follow my coffee journey and latte art portfolio <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reems_latte/">on my coffee-oriented instagram page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          TL;DR   I ❤️ coffee and I'm currently working as a barista while learning web dev.
          </p>

          <p>P.S. I'm currently going through the #100daysofcode challenge on Twitter. I may not be able to code every waking day for 100 days, but I'll be documenting all the days I actually do code and get far. Follow my journey at <a href="https://twitter.com/reemcodes">@reemcodes</a>.</p>
